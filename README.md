## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)

- A PostgreSQL database instance (local or remote)

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [YOUR-REPO-URL]
cd hospitality-staff-manager-app
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3\. Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and configure the following variables:

```env
# Database Connection (Prisma)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[USER]:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:[PORT]/[DATABASE_NAME]?schema=public"

# Clerk Authentication (Required for sign-up/sign-in)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="[YOUR_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY]"
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="[YOUR_CLERK_SECRET_KEY]"

# Optional: Vercel/Next.js specific
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV=development
```

### 4\. Database Setup

Apply the Prisma schema and generate the client:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate
```

This command will create the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database.

### 5\. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
